# Fuel Efficiency Analysis

This project analyzes a dataset on vehicle fuel efficiency. The analysis includes visualizations such as histograms and heatmaps to understand the distribution and relationships between various features.

## Files

- `fuel_efficiency_analysis.ipynb`: The main Jupyter Notebook with the analysis code and plots.
- `data/fuel_econ.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `plots/histogram.png`: A histogram showing the distribution of cylinders.
- `plots/heatmap.png`: A heatmap showing the correlation between various features.

## Instructions

1. Open `fuel_efficiency_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Run the cells to load the dataset, generate plots, and interpret the results.
3. The plots will be saved in the `plots/` folder as PNG files.
